## âœ¨ What is Postglide?

**Postglide** is a Vitess-inspired, protocol-level router and connection orchestrator for PostgreSQL, written in Go.

It sits between your clients and a fleet of PostgreSQL databases, providing:

- ðŸšª **Smart connection routing** (based on database name, tenant ID, or custom rules)
- ðŸ§µ **Connection pooling** (per backend, per tenant)
- ðŸ”€ **Sharding logic support** (in future versions)
- ðŸ“¦ **Transparent wire protocol proxying** (PostgreSQL-compatible)

Whether you're running a **multi-tenant SaaS**, need **connection isolation**, or want to centralize access to **hundreds of Postgres instances**, Postglide helps you do that with elegance.
